# iOS Sinch SDK - Getting Started

  

This is documentation how to easily implement our SDK for chat and for push features.
  

# Requirements

- Xcode 13+
- Swift package manager (****iOS 11+****) ****OR**** Cocoapods (****iOS 12+****)

# Installation

### Swift Package Manager:

1. Copy link to this repository `https://github.com/sinchlabs/sinch-chat-ios-sdk`
2. Paste into xCode SPM and login to your github account using login + github personal token.

### Cocoapods:

1. Add you ssh key with access to this repository.
2. Add to podfile line: `pod 'SinchChatSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/sinchlabs/sinch-chat-ios-sdk'`

# First steps

1. Initialize SDK as soon as application is starting.

2. SetIdentity as soon as you can authenticate the user using your internal ****UserID**** and sign it using algorithm on ****the backend side.**** (You can sign it on mobile but it is ****NOT RECOMMENDED****) ← this method can be called multiple times.
3. Setup push notifications.
4. Show chat.

### Info.plist permissions
We need two permissions in info.plist:

- Push notifications permission:
- Capability → `Push Notifications`
- Capability → `background modes` → `Remote notifications` + explanation in info.plist:
```swift
<dict>
	<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
		<string>remote-notification</string>
	</array>
</dct>

```
## Initialize

```swift
SinchChatSDK.shared.initialize()
```
As soon as possible it means the best place to do that is AppDelegate in:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool
```
Example:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
	SinchChatSDK.shared.initialize()
	return true
}

```
### Config
We need to have configuration for chat which we’re providing to you it means you need:
- Region

- Project ID

- Client ID

- *_(Optional)_* Token secret

## Set identity
The second step is that we need to authorize user so we need you to call us this method as soon as you can authorize the user. You can call this method as many times as you want:

```swift

func setIdentity(with config: SinchSDKConfig.AppConfig, identity: SinchSDKIdentity, completion: ((Result<Void, SinchSDKIdentityError>) -> Void)? = nil)

```

Example:

```swift

SinchChatSDK.shared.setIdentity(with: currentEnvironment.toSinchConfig, identity: currentIdentityType) { result in
	switch result {
	case .success:
		// SDK is authenticated successfully.
	case .failure(let error):
		// SDK cannot be initizalized so you can't use any functionality :/
	}
}
```
And now you can use SDK functionalities like chat or push.
# Chat

  

## Check chat availability

To check if the chat is available for user you should use method:
```swift
public enum SinchSDKChatAvailability {
	/// The Chat is ready to user.
	case available
	
	/// The Chat is not initialized
	/// Tip: use initialize method to initialize chat.
	case uninitialized

	/// The chat is not authorized
	/// Tip: User setIdentity method to authorize the client.
	case authorizationNeeded

	/// The chat is opened
	/// You cannot run two chats at once.
	case currentlyRunning
}

func isChatAvailable() -> SinchSDKChatAvailability

```

## Showing chat

  

****Before showing the chat make sure you have initialised this SDK.****

You have couple of options how you can show chat.
You can use your own UINavigationController to show our chat.
You can just present our chat using standard transitions or your custom ones.
To do that there is method in `SinchChatSDK.shared.chat.*`

<aside>
💡 If you will pass `navigationController == nil` then we will create our own because we need it anyway.
</aside>

```swift
func getChatViewController(navigationController: UINavigationController?,
						   uiConfig: SinchSDKConfig.UIConfig?,
						   localizationConfig: SinchSDKConfig.LocalizationConfig?) throws -> UIViewController
```
<aside>
💡 We’re returning `UIViewController` which you have to present in ****your own**** way.
</aside>
<aside>
💡 We’re currently supporting English language only, if you want to have other languages as well then override `localizationConfig` parameter.
</aside>
****Example:****

```swift
do {
	let chatViewController = try SinchChatSDK.shared.chat.getChatViewController()
	chatViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .fullScreen
	present(chatViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
} catch {
	// all errors are related with bad configuration. You can check if chat is available using `isChatAvailable` method.
}
```
# Push

### APNS certificate

To use ****push notifications**** with this SDK you have to provide ****APNS Key**** and upload it to out Sinch Panel.
<aside>
💡 Push notification works only on ****real device.****
</aside>

### Xcode Capabilities

  

Make sure you’ve checked `Remove notifications` capability in `Background Modes` in your target configuration in tab `Signing & Capabilities` and `Push Notifications` .  

### Methods in AppDelegate.swift or AppDelegate.m:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
	SinchChatSDK.shared.push.sendDeviceToken(deviceToken)
}

```
<aside>
💡 Make sure you’ve added `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` to AppDelegate definition or to you own class.
</aside>

```swift
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {

	if SinchChatSDK.shared.push.handleNotificationResponse(response) {
		// this is our notification and it is handled by SinchChatSDK
	}

	completionHandler()
}
```

```swift
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, willPresent notification: UNNotification, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {

	if let presentationOptions = SinchChatSDK.shared.push.handleWillPresentNotification(notification) {
		completionHandler(presentationOptions)
		return
	}
	completionHandler([])
}

```

### Additional methods

Those methods are ****optional**** and they are only ****helpers for you**** if you want to ask for notifications in other places then after starting the chat. Please don’t ask user for notification at application start. ****It is a bad practice.**** Ask when you need it.

Possibility to check push permission using our method:

```swift
SinchChatSDK.shared.push.checkPushPermission(completion: @escaping (SinchSDKNotificationStatus) -> Void)

// OR iOS 13+ with Combine
func checkPushPermission() -> AnyPublisher<SinchSDKNotificationStatus, Never>
```
Possibility to ask for notifications permission:
```swift
func askNotificationPermission(completion: @escaping (SinchSDKNotificationStatus) -> Void)

// OR iOS 13+ with Combine
func askNotificationPermission() -> AnyPublisher<SinchSDKNotificationStatus, Never>
```
